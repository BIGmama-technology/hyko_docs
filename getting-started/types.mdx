In order to connect nodes together, you need to match their port types.
Ports have different colors corresponding to their types, making it easy to visually identify and connect compatible ports.

## Basic Types

1. Text: Represents string data, such as words, sentences, or paragraphs.
2. Number: Represents numerical data, including whole and decimal numbers.
3. Image: Represents image files in various formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GIF).
4. Video: Represents video files in common formats (e.g., MP4, AVI, MOV).
5. Audio: Represents audio files in formats like MP3, WAV and so on.

## Other Types

6. File: Represents any type of file (image, video, audio ..), useful for general file handling operations.
7. Any: A flexible type that can represent any data type, allowing for more dynamic connections.

## List Types

All of the previous types can be wrapped in a list, creating new types such as list[image] or list[text]. These list types allow you to work with collections of data.

When working with lists, keep in mind:

1. You can only connect a list port to a compatible list port.
2. Consider using [loop mode](https://docs.hyko.ai/advanced/loop-mode) with nodes that dont handle lists by default.
3. Intermediate nodes may help you match the types of two ports that are not directly compatible.
